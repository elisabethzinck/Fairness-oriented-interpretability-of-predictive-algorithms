*Write introduction here*

## biasbalancer 
*Write about what BiasBalancer can do here*. The documentation of biasbalancer is found [here](https://elisabethzinck.github.io/Fairness-oriented-interpretability-of-predictive-algorithms/html/index.html). The tutorial notebook (located in [`src_biasbalancer/biasbalancer_tutorial.ipynb`](https://github.com/elisabethzinck/Fairness-oriented-interpretability-of-predictive-algorithms/blob/main/src_biasbalancer/biasbalancer_tutorial.ipynb)) gives a brief introduction to biasbalancer and showcases the use of the toolkit using the classical COMPAS dataset. 

### Installation
All source code for biasbalancer is found in the folder `src_biasbalancer`. Biasbalancer can be installed as a package in the following way: 

- Step 0: Install python3 (preferably using the Anaconda Distribution). 
- Step 1: Download the folder `src_biasbalancer`. 
- Step 2: Create a virtual python environment. This is done by opening the terminal in the repository's path and running the following command `conda env create --name <your_env_name> --file requirements.txt`. This will install the packages required by biasbalancer along with biasbalancer itself. 
- Step 3: Activate environment with command `conda activate <your_env_name>`. 
- Step 4: Now it should be possible to import biasbalancer by running `import biasbalancer` in python.
